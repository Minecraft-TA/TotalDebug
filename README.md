Forge mod providing useful utilities when automating to the extreme.

- Adds a block which shows how often per second it is ticked
- Allows you to view the decompiled classes of Blocks, Tile Entities and more while you're in-game.
- Allows you to search for method and field references in every loaded class (e.g. find every block that accelerates 
  tile entities)
