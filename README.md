# Total Debug
Forge mod providing useful utilities when automating to the extreme.

- Adds a block which shows how often per second it is ticked
- Adds a minimap like chunk view, similar to CarpetClient
- Allows you to run java code on your server or client while in-game
- Allows you to view the decompiled classes of Blocks, Tile Entities and more while you're in-game.
- Allows you to search for method and field references in every loaded class (e.g. find every block that accelerates 
  tile entities)
- Allows you to record and view sent packets to and from the client
- Displays TPS and MSPT when you press tab

Most of these features are accessible through the companion app for this mod, which can be
